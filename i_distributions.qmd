## Univariate Distributions

### The Normal Distribution

A normal distribution, also known as a Gaussian distribution, is a continuous probability distribution that has a bell-shaped curve. The normal distribution is characterized by two parameters: the mean ($\mu$) and the standard deviation ($\sigma$). The following are the key properties of a normal density curve:

-   Symmetry: The curve is symmetric around the mean.
-   Unimodal: The curve has a single peak, known as the mode, which coincides with the mean and the median.
-   Asymptotic: The tails of the curve extend infinitely in both directions, approaching but never touching the horizontal axis.
-   Total area: The total area under the curve is equal to 1, representing the probability of all possible outcomes.


### A tale of two z-scores

There are two z-score formulas used for very different purposes. The first is used to compare a single data point to a distribution for which you know the mean and standard deviation. The second is used to compare a sample mean to a a distribution of sample means.

**Comparing a single data point to a population**

In this case, imagine you know the population mean and standard deviation. You want to know how many standard deviations a single data point is from the mean. This is calculated using the following formula:

$z = \frac{(X_i - \mu)}{\sigma}$

where:

-   $z$ is the z-score
-   $X_i$ is the individual observation
-   $\mu$ is the mean of the distribution
-   $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the distribution

**Comparing a sample mean to a distribution of sample means**

In this case, you are preforming a hypothesis test. You want to know how many standard deviations a sample mean is from the hypothesized population mean. This is calculated using the following formula:

$$
z = \frac{(\bar{X} - \mu)}{\left(\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\right)}
$$

or equivalently:

$$
z = \frac{(\bar{X} - \mu)}{\sigma_{\bar{X}}}
$$

where:

-   $z$ is the z-score
-   $\bar{X}$ is the sample mean (or other statistic)
-   $\mu$ is the sampling distribution mean (or other statistic)
-   $\sigma_{\bar{X}}$ is the standard deviation of the distribution of sample means (or other statistic)

68-95-99.7 Rule: Approximately 68% of the observations fall within one standard deviation of the mean ($\mu \pm \sigma$), 95% within two standard deviations ($\mu \pm 2\sigma$), and 99.7% within three standard deviations ($\mu \pm 3\sigma$).

## The Student's t-Distribution

The Student's t-distribution, often simply referred to as the t-distribution, is a continuous probability distribution that is symmetric and bell-shaped, similar to the normal distribution. The t-distribution, however, has heavier tails. This distribution arises when estimating the mean of a normally distributed population when the sample size is small and the population standard deviation is unknown. 

The t-distribution is characterized by a single parameter: the degrees of freedom (df), which relates to the sample size of the data. As the degrees of freedom increase, the t-distribution approaches the standard normal distribution. The key properties of the t-distribution are:

- Symmetry: The t-distribution is symmetric around zero.
- Unimodal: Like the normal distribution, the t-distribution has a single peak at zero.
- Heavier tails: The t-distribution has heavier tails than the normal distribution. This reflects increased uncertainty when sample sizes are small.
- Total area: The total area under the t-distribution curve is equal to 1, representing the probability of all possible outcomes.

## Calculating t-scores

Unlike the two z-score formulas, people generally only use a single t-score formula. The t-score is used to compare a sample mean (or another statistic) to a hypothesized distribution of means (or another statistic) when the population standard deviation is unknown. This is calculated using the following formula:

$$
t = \frac{(\bar{X} - \mu)}{\left(\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}\right)}
$$

or equivalently:

$$
t = \frac{(\bar{X} - \mu)}{s_{\bar{X}}}
$$

where:

-   $t$ is the t-score
-   $\bar{X}$ is sample mean (or other statistic)
-   $\mu$ is the hypothesized population mean (or other statistic)
-   $s_{\bar{X}}$ is the standard deviation of the distribution of sample means (or other statistic)
-   $n$ is the sample size

t-scores are used when the population mean and standard deviation are unknown, which often is the case with real-world data. t-scores are also used in the calculation of confidence intervals and in hypothesis testing.
