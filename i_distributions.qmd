## Univariate Distributions

### The Normal Distribution

A normal distribution, also known as a Gaussian distribution, is a continuous probability distribution that has a bell-shaped curve. The normal distribution is characterized by two parameters: the mean ($\mu$) and the standard deviation ($\sigma$). The following are the key properties of a normal density curve:

-   Symmetry: The curve is symmetric around the mean.
-   Unimodal: The curve has a single peak, known as the mode, which coincides with the mean and the median.
-   Asymptotic: The tails of the curve extend infinitely in both directions, approaching but never touching the horizontal axis.
-   Total area: The total area under the curve is equal to 1, representing the probability of all possible outcomes.

### Calculating Z-scores

A z-score is a standardized measure that indicates the relative position of a data point within a distribution. It is calculated using the following formula:

$z = \frac{(x - \mu)}{\sigma}$

where:

-   $z$ is the z-score
-   $x$ is the individual observation
-   $\mu$ is the mean of the distribution
-   $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the distribution

68-95-99.7 Rule: Approximately 68% of the observations fall within one standard deviation of the mean ($\mu \pm \sigma$), 95% within two standard deviations ($\mu \pm 2\sigma$), and 99.7% within three standard deviations ($\mu \pm 3\sigma$).

## The Student's t-Distribution

The Student's t-distribution, often simply referred to as the t-distribution, is a continuous probability distribution that is symmetric and bell-shaped, similar to the normal distribution. The t-distribution, however, has heavier tails. This distribution arises when estimating the mean of a normally distributed population when the sample size is small and the population standard deviation is unknown. 

The t-distribution is characterized by a single parameter: the degrees of freedom (df), which relates to the sample size of the data. As the degrees of freedom increase, the t-distribution approaches the standard normal distribution. The key properties of the t-distribution are:

- Symmetry: The t-distribution is symmetric around zero.
- Unimodal: Like the normal distribution, the t-distribution has a single peak at zero.
- Heavier tails: The t-distribution has heavier tails than the normal distribution. This reflects increased uncertainty when sample sizes are small.
- Total area: The total area under the t-distribution curve is equal to 1, representing the probability of all possible outcomes.

## Calculating t-scores

A t-score is a type of standard score computed by subtracting the population mean from a sample score and then dividing by the sample standard deviation. It is calculated using the following formula:

$t = \frac{(X - \bar{X})}{\left(\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}\right)}$

where:

-   $t$ is the t-score
-   $x$ is the individual observation
-   $\bar{x}$ is the sample mean
-   $s$ is the sample standard deviation
-   $n$ is the sample size

t-scores are used when the population mean and standard deviation are unknown, which often is the case with real-world data. t-scores are also used in the calculation of confidence intervals and in hypothesis testing.
